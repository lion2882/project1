        <h2 id="e1">Imperial System</h2>
        <p>The Imperial System is also called The British<br>
             Imperial because it came from the<br>
             British Empire that ruled many parts of the world <br>
             from the 16th to the 19th century. <br>
             After the U.S gained independence from Britain, the new <br>
             American government decided to keep this type of measurement, <br>
             even though the metric system was gaining in popularity at the time.</p>
            <h3 id="v1">VISIBILITY</h3>
            <p>In meteorology, visibility is a measure of the distance<br>
                 at which an object or light can be clearly discerned.<br>
                  It is reported within surface weather observations and<br> 
                  METAR code either in meters or statute miles, depending upon<br>
                   the country. Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads,<br> 
                   sailing and aviation. Meteorological visibility refers to<br> 
                   transparency of air: in dark, meteorological visibility is<br>
                    still the same as in daylight for the same air.</p>

                    <h2 id="e2"> Metric system</h2>
                In the United States, both the U.S. customary measurement<br> 
                system and the metric system are used,<br>
                     especially in medical, scientific, and technical fields. <br>
                     In most other countries, the metric system is the primary <br>
                     system of measurement. If you travel to other countries, <br>
                     you will see that road signs list distances in kilometers and milk<br>
                      is sold in liters. People in many countries use words like <br>
                      “kilometer,” “liter,” and “milligram” to measure the length, volume,<br>
                       and weight of different objects. These measurement units are <br>
                       part of the metric system.<br>
                    Unlike the U.S. customary system of measurement, the metric <br>
                    system is based on 10s. For example,<br>
                     a liter is 10 times larger than a deciliter, and a centigram is <br>
                     10 times larger than a milligram. This idea of “10” is not<br> 
                     present in the U.S. customary system—there are 12 inches in a foot, <br>
                     and 3 feet in a yard…and 5,280 feet in a mile!<br>

                <h2 id="e3">Climate Vs Weather</h2>
                    The difference between weather and climate is a measure<br>
                     of time. Weather is what conditions of the atmosphere are over<br>
                      a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere "behaves"<br>
                       over relatively long periods of time.<br>
                    When we talk about climate change, we talk about changes in long-term<br>
                     averages of daily weather. Today, children always hear stories from<br>
                      their parents and grandparents about how snow was always piled up to<br>
                       their waists as they trudged off to school. Children today in most <br>
                       areas of the country haven't experienced those kinds of dreadful <br>
                       snow-packed winters, except for the Northeastern U.S. in January 2005.<br>
                        The change in recent winter snows indicate that the climate has changed<br>
                         since their parents were young.If summers seem hotter lately, then the<br>
                          recent climate may have changed. In various parts of the world, some <br>
                          people have even noticed that springtime comes earlier now than it did<br> 
                          30 years ago. An earlier springtime is indicative of a possible change <br>
                          in the climate.<br>
